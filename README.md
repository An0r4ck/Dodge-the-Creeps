# Dodge the Creeps

My first ever video game made in the Godot game engine.

## Description

This was a project meant to help me learn the basics of making a video game in the Godot game engine and help me understand the basics of game design.

## Features

- **Menu with a functioning Start Game button**: On the front screen of the game is a button with the words "Start Game" which starts the game when clicked on.
- **Score counter**: At the top of the screen while the game is playing is a number that keeps score by incrementally increasing the longer the player goes without getting hit by the mobs.
- **Game Over screen**: When the player character comes in contact with a mob, a screen displays with the words "Game Over" and then goes back to the beginning screen after a short pause.
